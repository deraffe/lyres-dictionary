# Lyre's Dictionary

Lyre's Dictionary generates novel but plausible English words based on actual roots and patterns in English.

It is also a pair of bot accounts on Twitter(@lyresdictionary) and Mastodon(@botsin.space@lyresdictionary) that post dictionary entries generated by it.

## Usage

To run Lyre's Dictionary in the console, run lyre.py with the flag '--test'. It will generate an entry for one word and print it to the console.

To generate more entries at once, use the flag '-c' followed by an integer value.

To generate an entry for a specific word, use the flag '-k' followed by a comma-separated list of keys. The keys used are those in the "key" field of the entries in the morphs JSON files (located in the _data_ directory).

For example, the following command:
```
python3 lyre.py --test -k cornus,ate-bodypart
```

gives the following output:
> cornuate (adj)<br>
> having horns

## Requirements

Due to dependencies, Lyre's Dictionary requires Python 3.6 or higher to run.

## Posting on social media

Lyre's Dictionary uses Bot Buddy for posting to its social media accounts. Bot Buddy does not currently exist in any package manager, but you can find the [source on Github](https://github.com/inthescales/bot-buddy).
